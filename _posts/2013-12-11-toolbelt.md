Infrequent blog posts are something everyone who is "trying to get into it"
will eventually write about; myself included! That is (sort of) what this post
is about. I am going to try and be a little more constructive about it, however,
as I think half of the things that gets most people into blogging is having an
idea that they are just *burning* to write about. Past that though, they may not
have much else they want to write about for fear of their posts coming off as
contrived, or overbearingly subjective.

In this case, what I am going to try is writing about things of a (hopefully)
constructive nature. One of the biggest, long-running goals of the tech
industry is to share information; if it is not, it definitely should be. So,
without delaying any further, here is my blog post about my "toolbelt"; the
tools I am currently looking at, and actively using.

## Server-side

### Go

Most of the work I do, on a day-to-day basis, lives mostly on a server,
somewhere; I like to keep it that way. I am not one much for fancy GUIs or
web interfaces, and I &mdash; personally &mdash; find writing such things a
pain in the arse. My tasks mostly involve writing web services, and finding
something that just does not feel "automated" enough, and automating it further.

### Database(s)

## Text editor(s)

### Emacs

### Sublime Text 3

## Front-end

### Handlebars.js

### Bootstrap

### jQuery (by proxy)
